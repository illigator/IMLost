Take this thing and put it to use


I'm not a programmer, I'm just someone who tinkers with a little bit of everything and knows not a thing about any of them. 

I'd really like for this to get picked up by someone and given access to, potentially coming equipped, with every phone.

I'll do my best which won't be much, but I'll describe everything in the app when I upload what I have.

Basically, it's an emergency location application to alert people from emergency services and OSINT hobbyists to aid in the rescue and relief of missing, lost, kidnapped, or otherwise endangered persons.
